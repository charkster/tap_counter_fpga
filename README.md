# tap_counter_fpga
Copilot (ChatGPT) created button press counter. I added the LED toggle function manually. I tried to describe the LED toggle function based on count to Copilot, but it would consistently implement it incorrectly. There is definitely a limit to the complexity of the design that it can correctly implement.
